                <li>Found that using a super-condensed font was hard to read for longer talk titles. Instead opted to use serif for my speaking section; feels cleaner and less dense.</li>
                <li>Took new linking strategy for talks, so I can share both videos and slides as separate links. Triggered by <a class="t-link-accent-pink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQq_gZiZ-jg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PerfMatters talk</a> being added!</li>
                <li>Added a <code>span-row-three</code> for use at larger screen sizes (triggered by the Empress addition to sponsors section), though this time I remembered to write it for my full screen-size range, bc I will need it later.</li>
                <li>When validating my HTML, I realised a few SVG <code>textPaths</code> had duplicate <code>ids</code> and <code>hrefs</code>. Whoops.</li>

                Accessibility</h3>

                <li>Migrated to <a class="t-link-accent-pink" href="https://netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netlify</a>, which feels like it spoils developers compared to what we had to go through before. I'm still very new to it, but I love that SSL certificates are built in, that there's a compiler/minifier, and RIP FTP! All performance and developer experience wins all around.</li>

                Version 1.2.1</h2>
            <p class="t-white">Launched my <a class="t-link-accent-pink" href="https://www.patreon.com/tatianamac/"
                    target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patreon</a>, so this update was fueled by adding a
                sponsorship section to reflect that. Adding a section visually impacted flow, which gave me a chance

                Content</h3>

                <li>Added section for sponsorship to both encourage new patronage and to thank current ones.</li>

                Systems</h3>
            <ul class="longform">
                <li>In some CSS explorations, I learned that <code>filter</code> can't be compounded. But, because
                    it has overlap qualities with <code>box-shadow</code>, I doubled them up for this fun 8-bit                        effect to highlight top-level sponsors. It's a progressive enhancement, so I'm less concerned  about the fact that its browser support isn't across the board.</li>
                <li>A friendly reminder to myself that I should always just write my full <code>@mixins</code>.
                    Because I structured my CSS to media-query at the component level (in markup), I always end up
                    needing that flexibility. I get lazy sometimes and always regret it. I really enjoyed
                    refactoring my CSS this way.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3
                class="t-serifweight t-normiefont@xs t-normiefont@s t-normiefont@m t-normiefont@l t-normiefont@xl t-space-strip t-light-green">
                Performance</h3>
            <ul class="longform">
                <li>Broke up with Typekit. It was too heavy. I purchased font licences and localised all my typography. I found this <a class="t-link-accent-pink" href="https://css-tricks.com/understanding-web-fonts-getting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">webfonts article by Thierry Blancpain</a> to be extra helpful.</li>
                <li>Applied <code>font-display: swap</code> to my <code>@font-face</code> declarations. What <code>font-display: swap</code> does is it tells the browser to use your fallback fonts while your custom fonts are being downloaded, so the user isn't waiting for fonts to load to read. Support is not ubiquitous yet, and hosted fonts like Typekit and Google Fonts don't support it, so you have to self host (see above).</li>
                <li>Added <code>prefetch</code> as a support for <code>font-display: swap</code>. Together, this the dynamic font-loading duo we need.</li>
                <li>Friend <a class="t-link-accent-pink" href="https://www.zachleat.com/web/comprehensive-webfonts/#font-display" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zach Leatherman's article on comprehensive webfonts</a> is one of the best resources. Zach is so good at explaining technical things in an accessible way.
                <li>Also, friend <a class="t-link-accent-pink" href="https://noti.st/mandy/AzhOpz/performance-benefits-of-variable-fonts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mandy Michael's talk on variable fonts</a> inspires me as a next step.</li>
                <li>Oh,  and because of these improvements, I kicked my PageSpeed score up from 98 to 100 for mobile. Now, I'm rocking double 100s! I'm super proud of this. Have you checked your <a class="t-link-accent-pink" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PageSpeed Insights</a>?</li>

                Security</h3>
            <ul class="longform">
                <li>Added <code>noreferrer</code> and <code>noopener</code> to all my external links. Lots of nuance
                    here, but tl;dr is that in doing so, it does not allow browsing data to be passed forward to the
                    site being opened and closes vulnerabilities of opening a new browser window when using
                    <code>target="_blank"</code>, respectively. Because I don't care to invade my users' privacy,
                    this has no impact on my analytics. People who want to steal information about their users by
                    way of Google Analytics and other tracking should avoid this. Also, I learned that this doesn't
                    have a negative SEO impact, which many misunderstand it to.</li>

            <p class="t-white">Tax day release (why should I pay taxes to a corrupt government with a president who
                doesn't pay taxes?) made some substantial improvements to accessibility and performance. Inspired

                    rel="noreferrer noopener">PerfMatters</a>, I implemented some major performance improvements.

                    of CSS <code>radial-gradients()</code> and <code>outline</code> to get the stamp effect. In
                    unsupported browsers, it has more of a puzzle piece feel, which I dig.</li>
                <li>Added city stamps to show first (!) international speaking gigs! First time experimenting with
                    SVG <code>textPaths</code>. The semantics are odd to me; will need to read more. Also, when
                    running standard accessibility tests, it can get confused about contrast checking, so I had to

                    wasn't offering its performance weight. Bye boi, bye.</li>
                <li>Minified all my code: SVGs (using Jake Archibald's <a class="t-link-accent-pink"

                Accessibility</h3>
            <ul class="longform">
                <li>Created <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> area with anchor links to help access information more fluidly. Reminder: If you are about to use an <code>aria-label</code>, first ask yourself: Is there a semantic tag that intrinsically provides that landmark role? (The answer is almost always yes). I see a lot of navigations that are made with <code>divs</code> and this makes me cry a little bit.
                </li>
                <li>Replaced seasonless <code>&lt;divs&gt;</code> with semantic HTML. What a joy for screenreader
                    users to know the sections! I also had a revelation that <code>&lt;divs&gt;</code> should only
                    be used for things that have no content consequence. Said another way, if a section has meaning
                    from an information architecture perspective, it likely has a relevant semantic HTML tag. Taking
                    this approach, I think that <code>&lt;divs&gt;</code> should only have computational meaning; to
                    aid in making something look a certain way.</li>
                <li>Rearranged and removed h tags that didn't make sense. Thanks to my super-smart friend <a
                        href="https://www.twitter.com/MarcySutton" class="t-link-accent-pink" target="_blank"
                        rel="noreferrer noopener">Marcy Sutton</a> for pointing this out. Remember kids, h tag order
                    is separate from your visual hierarchy. Don't use h tags to represent sizing; make that
                    agnostic.</li>
                <li>Added Skip to content link with the help of my brilliant friend <a
                        href="https://www.twitter.com/ZoeBijl" class="t-link-accent-pink" target="_blank"

                <li>Rewrote <code>alt</code> tags to be more about the content, and less formal analysis. We have a
                    tendency to overdescribe. Conciseness and clarity over comprehensiveness.</li>
