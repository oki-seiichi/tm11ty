    <p>I was showing someone my old math notes to someone and they said to me, &quot;how did you write so small?&quot; I responded, &quot;a small pen.&quot;</p>
<p>I guess you could say this is a fair sense of my sense of humour. In essence, this joke is exactly my shitpost style.</p>
<p>I came across some old tweets that I wrote earlier this year. As my good friend says, they were big yikes. I was learning my shitpost style and hating on things just to hate on them. Looking back, many of those shitposts were just shitty. It might have gotten a laugh from a few internet buds, but at what cost?</p>
<p>Many fans of comedy will say that &quot;politically correct&quot; culture is killing humour. I think that it's a way to learn to be more clever. If your fun is rooted in mocking someone else, directly or indirectly, someone otherwise less powerful than you, you're just a bully. You've not evolved past a third grade schoolyard.</p>
<p>When I go to write something now intended for laughs, I consider more thoughtfully and carefully what I want out of it. I ask myself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What or who is the target of this joke?</li>
<li>Will there be inadvertant victims of this joke?</li>
<li>Is the target of the joke systemically oppressed?
<ul>
<li>If human, do I possess systemic or relative power or privilege over this individual or group?</li>
<li>Am I mocking them, or their oppression?</li>
<li>If a tool or product, how might I hurt the people who worked hard to create it and use it?</li>
<li>Am I passive aggressively masking feedback in a less meaningful, less direct, and harmful way? Do I know or could I get a hold of someone to whom I could give this feedback directly to?</li>
<li>Does my joke deincentivise progress that would otherwise nullify my joke?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If this goes viral, will I be willing and able to defend it?</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, I used to make fun of React and React developers. When making fun of how React is all white dudes, who I intended to target was the bigoted and racist white dudes who think that women don't know how to code. In the crossfires, I managed to erase anyone who was <em>not</em> that—maybe the only Black woman React developer on her all-white/all-male team; maybe the gender-non-conforming first-generation child of immigrants React developer whose the first to earn a six-figure salary.</p>
<p>I was literally hurting the very people that I'm fighting to protect in centring a bunch of dull-de-sacs who don't really care about my joke because they don't follow brown queer women anyway.</p>
<p>Making fun of the framework itself is another thing, sure, but will that incite meaningful change? Like, if the joke is that React ships a forktonne of unnecessary JS or that it's inaccessible by default, will some snarky comment get the React Core team to fix it? What do I really want out of this? And how could I accomplish it using less energy for myself in a more direct way?</p>
<p>Furthermore, will my snarky comment about React's inextricability to Facebook somehow extricate them? No.</p>
<p>And in anticipatory response, to be perfectly clear, I am not defending React, Facebook, dull-de-sac racists, or taking back any of the things I did earlier this year. Everything I did was defencible and I regret none of it. And at the same time, what I <em>am</em> doing is welcoming some introspection about the ancillary ways I once tried to get my message across.</p>
<p>Part of this introspection is growing up, I guess. It's also because in looking back at all that happened to me, other people's shitty shitposts—people on &quot;all sides&quot;—caused me immense and irreversible harm to me and others earlier this year. I see that the people who wrote many of those shitposts carry on writing more harmful shitposts. I can't change them, nor do I desire to, but I sure as hell don't want to do that.</p>
<p>As I continue to gain terrifying visibility, and because of the identity I possess in this world, I choose to be intentional about what I broadcast. I will always live as authentically to myself as possible. I will never sacrifice who I am for others. However, I can maintain individuality while recognising that as I gain more followers, influence, and power, what I do might cross many people's paths. Within that group could be people who admire my work or my message, or people whom I might already or will care about tremendously. That's what I learned from #Reactgate.</p>
<p>It might sound like a heavy burden to examine my actions so carefully but honestly? Society already forces me to do that by design anyway. Now, I'm just learning to make sure that I monitor my actions to protect myself rather than systems of oppression.</p>
<p>What it looks like now: I save a lot more drafts in my Twitter. I post less. I share some of the things I wanna say to close friends. I slow myself down. I take more time to consider the impact of my actions. I think about how wildly the fire can rage before I light the match.</p>
<p>As I get older and more tired and as my meatsack deteriorates, I work to conserve energy. I think about the energy it takes for me to light the match at all.  If I truly hate something, whether it be a tool or a person who is a tool, I ask if it's worth my energy to call attention to this. I ask myself it is worth sinking myself into a pit of hate for a moment—as someone who experiences depression, this is not something I am wont to do. I ask myself: Instead of using this match to burn someone undeserving down, could I instead use it to light the way for someone who deserves it?</p>
