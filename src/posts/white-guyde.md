## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Buy and read some anti-racist texts. And sit with the discomfort. Maybe invite a few other dudes to be in a book club with you

I curated this collection just for you. üòò

- An Indigenous People's History of the United States, Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz
- How To Be Antiracist, Ibram X Kendi
- How To Be Less Stupid About Race, Crystal M Fleming
- So You Wanna Talk About Race, Ijeoma Oluo
- The New Jim Crow, Michelle Alexander
- They Were Her Property, Stephanie E. Jones-Rogers
- White Fragility, Robin Diangelo
- White Tears, Brown Scars, Ruby Hamad
- Why I'm No Longer Talking About Race, Reni Eddo-Lodge (UK-centric)

If you want to understand how tech is complicit in perpetuating systems of oppression:

- Algorithms of Oppression, Safiya Noble
- Invisible Women, Caroline Criado P√©rez
- Rage Inside The Machine, Rob Smith
- Technically Wrong, Sara Watchter-Boettcher

You'll notice I didn't link them. I encourage you to do some work to support someone other than the world's first trillionaire. Find a local bookstore that might still be able to deliver/do curbside pickup. Look on [IndieBound](https://www.indiebound.org/) or [Bookshop](https://www.bookshop.org) if you truly don't have local options or are stuck. Part of doing this work is not always taking the first, most convenient option.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Unfollow everyone on social media and start over. Try to follow NO people who look like you*

Follow a spread of race, gender (expression, identity), orientation, physical ability, neurodiversity, nationality, socioeconomic status.

*I know you still will. I said try.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Spend a year only recommending and/or consuming media by people who don't look like you

(And if you just recommend/consume media by abled white women, I will not give you pistachio thin Oreo cookies).

This applies in all aspects of your life: On Twitter, for jobs, for reading, for books.

Sound hard? Well, 1 and 2 outta help you. But yeah, it's hard. Consider _why_ this is so hard, when most of the world isn't white or male.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ For every time you get the impulse to talk (live or asynchronously), try to only do it every third time

For the times you do talk, ask yourself:
üîπ Did I listen to understand?
üîπ Did someone already say this?
üîπ Am I adding something of value?
üîπ Are these my words to say?

5Ô∏è‚É£ Spend time connecting with your thoughts, then emotions.

Write down your observations in this new version of you. What do you notice?

Seek therapy/counseling if you have the means. If you don't think you need therapy, it likely means you're seeking it from people for free unknowingly.
[Read this comic on how you shift that load](https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/comment-page-9/) (not THAT kind of load).

Never allow yourself to stay comfortable. Comfort is complicity. Discomfort means change. Sit with it.
